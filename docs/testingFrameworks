Server uses PHP 7.0.23
Can use PHPUnit for a testing framework. https://phpunit.de/getting-started.html

Javascript testing frameworks seem to rely on Node.js being installed.
Node.js version 6.10.2 is on the server.

We can either use Mocha or Jest. 

Mocha is older and requires installation of more dependencies but has a lot of documentation. https://mochajs.org/

Jest comes with everything it needs but does not have as much documentation and IDE support. It comes with assertion and 
mocking libraries built in. https://facebook.github.io/jest/
